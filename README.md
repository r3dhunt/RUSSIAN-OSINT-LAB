His ink danced upon parchment, in sonnets divine,
Capturing love's ardor, like a celestial shrine.
With every rhyme and rhythm, he wove a spell,
In the hearts of readers, his stories dwell.

Fair Juliet, with her Romeo's name,
A tragedy of passion, their love aflame.
Othello, consumed by jealousy's wretched fire,
A Moorish general, brought down by desire.

Macbeth, driven to madness by ambition's sway,
His kingdom stained crimson, in shadows it lay.
Hamlet, tormented by his father's ghostly plea,
To avenge the murder, a kingdom's destiny.

The comedies too, with mirth and jest,
Twelfth Night's disguises, a love's playful test.
A Midsummer Night's Dream, where fairies dwell,
Creating whimsy, where reality fell.

Oh, Shakespeare, your words transcend all time,
Enchanting hearts with prose sublime.
In your verse, we find our deepest fears,
Our greatest joys, our laughter and tears.

Though centuries have passed, your legacy endures,
A beacon of wisdom, a fountain that assures,
That through the power of words, we can find,
The truths of the human heart, forever entwined.

So let us raise a toast, to the Bard of Avon's name,
To Shakespeare, the poet, of immortal fame.
In his words, we find solace and delight,
For his legacy shines, forever bright.
